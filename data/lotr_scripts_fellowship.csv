HALDIR,"Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. "
BILBO,"My old sword, Sting , Here, take it, take it. "
FRODO,Its so light! 
BILBO,"Yes Yes , Made by the elves you know.  The blade glows blue     when orcs are close and its times like that my lad, when you have to be     extra careful.    Here's a pretty thing. , Mithril!    ,     as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales.  Let me see you put     it on, go on. "
BILBO," My my     old ring.  Well I should... very much like to hold it again, one last     time.  "
BILBO,"I'm sorry I brought this upon you my boy    , I'm sorry that you must carry this     burden , I'm sorry for everything "
ELROND,"The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and     you who travel with him, , no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will    , Farewell. Hold to     your purpose and may the blessings of elves , and men ,,     and all free folk , go with     you.  "

ARAGORN,I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey 
BOROMIR," Then we are here on a     common purpose , friend. "
BOROMIR,"The shards of Narsil ,  The blade that cut the Ring from     Sauron's hand , Ah! ,Its still sharp , but no more than a broken heirloom    "
ARWEN,"Why do you fear the past.  You are Isildur's heir, not     Isildur himself.  You are not bound to his fate "
SAURON VOICE,Build     me an army worthy of Mordor 
ORC,What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command? 
SARUMAN,We have work to do

SAM,He's going cold!

ARAGORN, Haldir 
GIMLI,So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words     we can also understand! 
HALDIR,"We have not had dealings with the dwarves, since the dark     days. "
GIMLI,
ARAGORN, That! was not so courteous! 
HALDIR,"     You bring great evil with you ,You     can go no further! "
ARAGORN,Boe ammen veriad l'n. Andelu i ven! 
ARAGORN,Merin le telim.     
HALDIR,Aragorn!  
ARAGORN, Andelu i ven. 
GANDALF,"Frodo, come and help an old man ,How's your shoulder? "
SAM,"Mr Frodo ? , Frodo! Frodo!     , I thought I'd lost you "
FRODO,What are you talking about ? 
SAM,It's just something Gandalf said.  
FRODO,What did he say? 
GANDALF,The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.  
FRODO,"Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right ? "
GANDALF,     Left. 
GANDALF VOICEOVER,"We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for     forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.    , and there are     road turns east to Mordor. "
BOROMIR,"Good, very good.  "
ARAGORN,Move your feet 
MERRY,You look good Pippin 
PIPPIN,     Thanks  
GIMLI," If     anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say     that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the     Mines of Moria.  My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.  "
GANDALF,"No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I     had no other choice. "
PIPPIN,ARGH! 
BOROMIR,Sorry!  
MERRY,Get him!  
PIPPIN,"For the Shire.  Hold him, hold him down Merry!     "
ARAGORN,"Gentlemen, that's enough!  "
ARAGORN,"The same blood flows in my veins , The same weakness  "
ARWEN," Your time     will come.  You will face the same evil and you will defeat it       A si i-Dh'ath '-orthor, Aragorn. ' or le a ' or nin. "
ARWEN,"Renech i lu i erui govannen? (,) "
ARAGORN,Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen.
ARWEN,"Gwenwin in enninath...U-arnech in naeth i si celich. (,) Renech i beth i     pennen?  "
ARAGORN,"You said you would bind yourself to     me,foresaking     the immortal life of your people "
ARWEN,and to that I hold.  I would rather share one lifetime     with you than face all the ages of this world alone  
ARWEN,I choose a mortal life 
ARAGORN,You cannot give me this 
ARWEN,It is mine to give to whom I will.  Like my heart     
ELROND,"Strangers from distant lands, friends of old.  You have     been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.  Middle Earth stands     upon the brink of destruction.  None can escape it.  You will     unite or you will fall.  Each race is bound to this fate, this one     doom., Bring forth the Ring, Frodo "
BOROMIR, So     it's true  
BOROMIR,"In a dream , I saw the Eastern sky grow dark ,In the West a pale light lingered A     voice was crying, your doom is near at hand , Isildur's bane is found    , Isildur's Bane "
FRODO,"Put it out you fools! , Put it out! "
PIPPIN,Well that's nice! That's nice!  Ash on my tomatoes! 
FRODO,Go! 
SAM,Backl you Devils!  
SAM,     Frodo! 
FRODO,Oh Sam!  
SAM,Strider!     Help him Strider! 
STRIDER,"  He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.    , This is beyond my skill to heal.  He needs     elvish medicine  "
STRIDER,Hurry! 
SAM,It's six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it!  
STRIDER,Frodo Frodo 
FRODO VOICE,GANDALF! 
SAM,Athelas ?  
STRIDER,Kingsfoil 
SAM,"Kingsfoil, aye, its a weed! "
STRIDER,It may help to slow the poison.  Hurry! 
ARWEN,What's this ? a Ranger caught off his guard ?  
ARWEN,Frodo Im Arwen. Telin le thaed. Lasto beth nin. Tolo dan na galad     
MERRY,Who is she? 
ARWEN,Frodo 
SAM,She's an elf! 
ARWEN,He's fading  
ARWEN,He's not going to last.  We must get him to my father.  
ARWEN,"I've been looking for you for two days. , There are five wraiths behind you,     where the other four are I do not know "
STRIDER, Dartho     guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon. 
ARWEN,Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. 
STRIDER,Andelu i ven.  
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,I amar prestar aen     Han mathon ne nen     Han mathon ne chae     A han noston ned gwilith     Much that once was is lost. For none now live who remember it.
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,It began with the forging of the Great Rings.  
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"Three were given to the elves. ,Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.    , Seven to the     dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.    ,And nine, nine rings were     gifted to the race of men. , Who above all else, desire power.  "
FRODO,     Better than it was 
GANDALF,"and the Ring ? , You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it     too.  You must be careful now.  Evil will be drawn to you from     outside the Fellowship and I fear from within.  "
FRODO,Who then do I trust ? 
GANDALF,You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.  
FRODO,What do you mean ?  
GANDALF,There are many powers in this world for good or for evil.      Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested 
GIMLI, Ah!      The walls of Moria! 
GIMLI,Dwarf doors are invisible when closed  
GANDALF,"Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them, if their     secrets are forgotten! "
LEGOLAS,Why doesn't that surprise me! 
GIMLI,Ach! 
GANDALF,"It reads ""The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend     and Enter"" "
MERRY,What do you suppose that means ? 
GANDALF,"Oh it's quite simple.  If you are a friend, you speak     the password and the doors will open ,     Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! (     "
GANDALF,"Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen. "
SAM,Don't you lose him Samwise Gamgee and I don't mean to.  
FRODO,Sam! We're still in The Shire.  What could possibly     happen! 
PIPPIN,  Frodo!      Merry! Its Frodo Baggins! 
MERRY,Hello Frodo! 
SAM,"Get off him! ,     Frodo, are you alright? "
FRODO,What's the meaning of this ? 
MERRY,Hold these 
SAM,You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! 
MERRY,and these 
FARMER MAGGOT,"Hoi! You get back here! Wait till I get this through you!     , Get out of my fields! You'll know the devil if I catch     up with you! "
MERRY,Dunno why he's so upset!  Its only a couple of carrots 
PIPPIN, and some cabbages and those few     bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.  And the mushrooms the week     before. 
PIPPIN,You've got my arm... argh!... you've got my arm 
SAM,What is that ? 
GIMLI,"Nothing, its just a whisp of cloud "
BOROMIR,Its moving fast.... against the wind 
LEGOLAS,Crebain! From Dudland! 
ARAGORN,Hide!  
BOROMIR,Hurry! 
ARAGORN, Frodo! Take     cover! 
GANDALF,"Spies of Saruman.  The passage south is being watched    ,  We must take the     Pass of Caradhras  "
ARAGORN,Frodo!  
ARAGORN,Boromir  
BOROMIR,"It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and     doubt over so small a thing ,such a little thing  "
ARAGORN," Boromir!    ,     Give the Ring to Frodo  "
BOROMIR, as you wish! I care not  
ELROND,Boromir! 
GANDALF,"Ash nazg durbatul'k, ash nazg gimbatul        ash nazg thrakatul'k ,agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.    "
ELROND, Never     before has anyone uttered words of that tongue here in Imladris 
GANDALF,"I do not ask your pardon Master Elrond for the Black Speech     of Mordor may yet be heard in every corner of the West , The Ring is altogether     evil  "
BOROMIR," Aye it is a     gift! ,A gift to the foes of     Mordor. Why not use this Ring ? , Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor kept     the forces of Mordor at bey.  By the ,of our people are     your lands kept safe.  Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy, let us use     it against him   "
ARAGORN,"You cannot wield it.  None of us can    , The One Ring     answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master "
BOROMIR,and what would a     ranger know of this matter ? 
BOROMIR, Aragorn! This.. is Isildur's heir 
LEGOLAS,and heir to the throne of Gondor 
ARAGORN,"Havo dad, Legolas (,.) "
BOROMIR,"Gondor has     no King. , Gondor needs no King  "
GANDALF,Aragorn is right.  We cannot use it 
ELROND, You have     only one choice.  The Ring must be destroyed.  
GIMLI,Then what are we waiting for 
ELROND,"The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any     craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.      Only there can it be unmade.  It must be taken deep into Mordor and     cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came. ,One of you........... must do this "
GANDALF, Gwaihir go! Gwaihir 
PIPPIN,What are they saying ? 
ARWEN,"Frodo f'r. Ae athradon i hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon. "
MERRY AND PIPPIN, 
PIPPIN," ,   "
GAFFER,"There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves, others of a     less than savoury nature  "
NOAKES," War's brewing.    , The mountains are fair teeming with     goblins. "
SANDYMAN,Children's stories that's all that is.  You're beginning to sound     like that old Bilbo Baggins! Cracked he was! 
BILBO,"Hello, Hello, Fatty Bolger , Lovely to see you, Welcome, Welcome "
FRODO," Go     on Sam, ask Rosie for a dance. "
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"For within these rings was bound the strength and will     to govern each race. ,     But they were all of them deceived. ,For another ring was made. , In the land of Mordor, ,in the fires of Mount Doom (, the dark Lord Sauron forged in     secret a master Ring ,to control all others and into this Ring he poured     all his cruelty, his malice , and his will to     dominate all life. , One Ring to rule them all.  "
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the     power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. , A last     alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the     slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.  "
ELROND,Tangado haid!  
ELROND,Leithio i philinn!  
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"Victory was near. , But the     power of the Ring , could not be undone.  "
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"It was in this moment, ,that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword.  "
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth     was defeated. , The Ring passed to Isildur.    , Who had this one chance to destroy evil     forever. , But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted.    ,     And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.  "
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"It betrayed Isildur ,to his death. ,And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.    ,History became legend, legend     became myth, , and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of     all knowledge. , Until, when chance came    , It     ensnared a new bearer.  "
GOLLUM,My Precious!  
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep     into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. , And there it consumed him. "
GOLLUM,"It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious.     "
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,"The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For     five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave     it waited. ,     Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow     in the East, whispers of a nameless fear. , And     the Ring of Power perceived. ,     Its time had now come. , It abandoned Gollum.    , But something happened then     that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature     imaginable.  "
BILBO,What's this?  
GALADRIEL VOICE OVER,A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.         
PIPPIN, Nothing's     happening 
GANDALF," I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves, men and     orcs "
PIPPIN,What're you going to do then ? 
GANDALF,Knock your head against these doors Peregrin Took! and if     that does not shatter them and I'm allowed a little peace from foolish     questions I will try to find the opening words. 
GANDALF,"Ando Eldarinwa'a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa' "
ARAGORN,The Mines are no place for a pony even one so brave as Bill. 
SAM,BuBye Bill 
ARAGORN,"Go on, go on ,Don't worry Sam.  He knows the way home. ,) "
ARAGORN, Do not     disturb the water  
GANDALF, Oh it's useless 
FRODO,It's a riddle!  
FRODO,Speak friend... and enter.  What's the elvish word for     friend ? 
GANDALF,Mel..lon 
MERRY,"Yes Pippin, my point is, he's clearly over reacting! Run! "
PIPPIN,  Ooh!  that was     close!  
MERRY,Oh! I think I've broken something      
SAM, Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! 
MERRY,What?  It was just a detour. A shortcut 
SAM,A shortcut to what ? 
PIPPIN, Mushrooms!      
FRODO,I think we should get off the road. 
FRODO,Get off the road! Quick! 
SAM,Ssh.. be quiet 
MERRY,What was that! 
SAM, Anything ? 
FRODO,Nothing 
PIPPIN, What     is going on ? 
SARUMAN,"So Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.  And     if that fails, where then will you go ? "
SARUMAN VOICEOVER,If the mountain defeats you will you risk a more dangerous     road 
SARUMAN,Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! 
LEGOLAS,There is a fell voice on the air 
GANDALF,It's Saruman! 
ARAGORN,He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf! We must     turn back! 
GANDALF,"No! , Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith!  "
SARUMAN,Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva     notto-carinnar! 
BOROMIR,We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and     take the west road to my city! 
ARAGORN,The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! 
GIMLI,"If we cannot pass over the mountain, let us go under it! Let     us go through the Mines of Moria "
SARUMAN VOICEOVER,Moria... you fear to go into those mines. 
SARUMAN, the dwarves delved too greadily     and too deep 
SARUMAN VOICEOVER,You know what they woke in the dark of Khazad-d'm 
SARUMAN," Shadow, flame "
BOROMIR,"One does not simply walk into Mordor.  Its black gates     are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep     and the great eye is ever watchful.  Tis a barren wasteland, riddled     with fire and ash and dust.  The very air you breathe is a poisonous     fume.  Not with ten thousand men could you do this.    ,It is folly "
LEGOLAS, Have you     heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed 
GIMLI,and I suppose you think you're the one to do it. 
BOROMIR,"and if we fail what then ? , What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ? "
GIMLI, I will be     dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf 
GIMLI,Never trust an elf 
GANDALF,"Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst     ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be     destroyed "
GAFFER,"      Young Mr Frodo here, he's cracking! "
FRODO, and proud of     it! Cheers Gaffer!   
GAFFER,Cheers 
SANDYMAN,Well it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your     nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you.  
ROSIE,Good Night lads 
HOBBIT,"  Good     night, sweet maiden of the golden ale! "
SAM,Oi Mind who you're sweet talking! 
FRODO,"Don't worry Sam, Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one! "
SAM, Does she ? 
FRODO,      Good Night Sam  
GANDALF,Is it secret ? Is it safe ? 
FRODO,"Ha! , What are you     doing! "
GANDALF,"      Hold out your hand Frodo. Its quite cool.  ,  What can you see ?    , Can you see anything ? "
FRODO," Nothing.     There's nothing , Wait. There are     markings ,  Its some form of Elvish.  I can't     read it "
GANDALF,"There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which     I will not utter here.  "
SAM,"  Ah, I     think I'll just have another ale.  "
FRODO,"Oh no you dont , Go on     "
BILBO," So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and     they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook     us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by     one and squash us into jelly. , They     spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first     light cracked open over the top of the trees.  Poof!    , and turned them all into     stone! "
MERRY,Quickly  
MERRY,"No no! the big one, big one! "
BILBO,"Mrs Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.  Welcome welcome.      Are all these children yours ? "
MRS BRACEGIRDLE,Yeah 
BILBO,Good gracious you have been productive! 
BILBO,"     Sackville-Bagginses! ,     Quickly! Hide! "
BILBO,"Oh! Thankyou my boy You're a good lad Frodo. I'm very     selfish you know. , Yes,     I am.  Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother     and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of     all my numerous relations, you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.     "
FRODO,Bilbo have you been at the Gaffers homebrew ? 
BILBO,"No. Well yes, b b b but thats not the point. The point is,     Frodo, , You'll be     alright.  "
BILBO,A Ring!  
GOLLUM," Lost!    , My Precious is lost. "
GALADRIEL,For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the     fortunes of all. 
BILBO,"The 22nd day of September in the year 1400    ,by Shire     reckoning. , Bag End,     Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth.    , The Third Age of this world.  "
BILBO,"There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo     Baggins. ,Now, where to begin?     Ah, yes. ,Concerning Hobbits.  "
BILBO VOICEOVER,"Hobbits have been living and farming in the four     Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. , quite content to     ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. , Middle Earth being,     after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of     little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted     amongst the very wise.  "
BILBO," Frodo, someone at     the door. ,In fact, it     has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.    , A rather unfair observation    , As     we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales    ,and the smoking of pipeweed. , But where     our hearts truly lie , is in peace and quiet ,and good     tilled earth. ,For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.    ,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint    , But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is     no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.  "
BILBO,"Frodo, the door! ,     sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!  "
GANDALF,"Hmm hmm hmm hmm, Down from the door where it began, hmm     hmm hmm hmm "
GANDALF,"And I must follow if I can. , The road goes     ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road     has gone, and I must follow if I can.       "
FRODO,You're late!       
GIMLI,"Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the     dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone! "
GIMLI,This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call     it a Mine!  
GIMLI,A Mine! 
BOROMIR," This isn't     a mine, it's a tomb "
GIMLI, Nooooo!     NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo! 
LEGOLAS, Goblins!  
BOROMIR,We make for the gap of Rohan.  We should never have     come here 
BOROMIR,Now get out of here! Get out! 
MERRY,That black rider was looking for something. Or someone (he     walks up to Frodo and looks him in the face) Frodo ? 
PIPPIN,Get down! 
FRODO,"I have to leave the Shire. ,Sam and I must get to Bree "
MERRY, Right. Bucklebury     Ferry.  Follow me. 
PIPPIN,Run! 
MERRY,"Frodo, this way.  Follow me "
PIPPIN, Frodo! 
MERRY,Follow me. Run! 
MERRY,Get the rope Sam 
SAM,     Frodo!  
PIPPIN,Run Frodo! 
FRODO, No! 
PIPPIN,Frodo! Come on! 
GANDALF,Let the Ringbearer decide 
BOROMIR,"We cannot stay here! ,This will be the death of the     hobbits! "
GANDALF,Frodo ? 
FRODO, We will go through     the Mines 
GANDALF,So be it 
FRODO,Mordor! 
GANDALF,In the common tongue it says
PIPPIN,Done! 
MERRY,You're supposed to stick it in the ground     
PIPPIN,It is in the ground  
MERRY,Outside  
PIPPIN,It was your idea! 
FRODO,Bilbo! Bilbo!  Watch out for the dragon     
BILBO,"    Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand     years. "
MERRY,That was good! 
PIPPIN,Lets get another one! 
GANDALF,Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known! 
CROWD,Speech Bilbo  
FRODO,Speech! 
BILBO,"My dear Bagginses and Boffins, , Tooks and Brandybucks ,, Grubbs ,, Chubbs    ,, Hornblowers ,, Bulgers ,,     Bracegirdles ,, and Proudfoots "
PROUDFOOT HOBBIT, PROUDFEET!  
GANDALF,"A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.    , Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means     to.       "
FRODO,Its wonderful to see you Gandalf. 
GANDALF,You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?     
GANDALF,So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a     party of special significance?       
FRODO,You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar. 
GANDALF,Well that should please him.  
FRODO,Half the Shire's been invited.     And the rest of them are turning up anyway.  
BILBO VOICEOVER,"And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has     this past age. , Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly, if it comes at all. ,For things are made to endure in     the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End        "
BILBO,And there always will be.       
FRODO,"To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd     lately. ,I     mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study.    , He spends hours     and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.       "
BILBO,Where's it gone?       
BILBO,Aaaaah.  
FRODO,"He's up to something. , All right then,     keep your secrets! "
GANDALF,What?  
MERRY AND PIPPIN,Frodo! Frodo! 
SAM,"Strider! , Get off him!     "
MERRY,Aragorn! 
MERRY,Frodo! 
FRODO,Strider! 
GANDALF,Into the Mines! 
BOROMIR,Legolas!  
GANDALF,"We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of     Moria.  Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs     in the deep places of the world  "
GANDALF,"The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril "
GANDALF,Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him 
GIMLI,Aww that was a Kingly gift 
GANDALF,"Yes.  I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!  "
MERRY,Pippin! 
GANDALF,I've no memory of this place 
PIPPIN,Are we lost ? 
SAM,Frodo! Come on! 
PIPPIN,Frodo! 
SAM,Come on faster! 
FRODO,How far to the nearest crossing ? 
MERRY,"     The Brandywine Bridge, twenty miles. "
FRODO,Come on!  
GATEKEEPER,What do you want ? 
FRODO,We're heading for the Prancing Pony. 
GATEKEEPR,Hobbits! Four hobbits!  What's more out of     The Shire by your talk!  What business brings you to Bree? 
FRODO,We wish to at the Inn.  Our business is our own. 
GATEKEEPER," alright young sir, I     meant no offence. ,My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk     abroad. Can't be too careful  "
MAN,Out of the way! Watch where you're walking! 
FRODO,Excuse me ?  
BILBO,Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday!     
HOBBIT,Happy Birthday! 
BILBO,"Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live     among such excellent and admirable hobbits.,  I don't know half of you half as well as I     should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve.    "
FRODO,But I know you have something to do with it.       
GANDALF,Good gracious me!       
FRODO,Before you came along we Bagginses were very well     thought of.       
GANDALF,Indeed? 
FRODO,"We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected.       "
GANDALF,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door.       "
FRODO,"Whatever you did, you've been officially labelled as a     'disturber of the peace.' "
GANDALF,Oh really? 
CHILDREN HOBBITS,Gandalf! Gandalf!       
CHILDREN HOBBITS,Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf!       
CHILDREN HOBBITS,Hooooraaaay!        
FRODO,"Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.  "
MERRY,No 
PIPPIN,I think we are 
SAM,Ssh! Gandalf's thinking 
PIPPIN,Merry! 
MERRY,What! 
PIPPIN,I'm hungry 
FRODO,There's something down there 
GANDALF,It's Gollum 
FRODO,Gollum! 
GANDALF,He's been following us for three days 
FRODO,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r! 
GANDALF,"Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,      He won't ever be rid of his need for it.  He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself.  Smeagol's life is a sad story    ,  Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad "
FRODO,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance 
GANDALF,"Pity ?  It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.      Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends.  My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.     ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many  "
FRODO,I wish the Ring had never come to me.  I wish none of     this had happened. 
GANDALF,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide.  All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us.  There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil.  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way "
BARLIMAN,"Good Evening little masters.  What can I do for you ?     If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized     rooms available.  Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ? "
FRODO," Underhill, my name's     Underhill "
BARLIMAN,"Underhill , yes.. "
FRODO,We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've     arrived? 
BARLIMAN,"Gandalf ?  ,Gandalf ? Oh yes!  I remember!  Elderly chap! Big grey     beard, pointy hat.  , Not seen     him for six months.  "
SAM,What do we do now ? 
FRODO,Sam. He'll be here.  He'll come. 
PIPPIN,What's that ? 
MERRY,"This my friend, is a pint!  "
PIPPIN,It comes in pints ? 
MERRY,hmmmhmmm 
PIPPIN,I'm getting one! 
SAM,You've had a whole half already! 
SAM,That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we     arrived!  
GANDALF,"So am I dear boy. , So am I. "
BILBO," No thank     you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!     "
GANDALF,And what about very old friends?       
BILBO,Gandalf?       
GANDALF,Bilbo Baggins.  
BILBO,My dear Gandalf!  
GANDALF,"It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old     who would believe it. ,     You haven't aged a day!  "
BILBO,"Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are.       "
BILBO,"Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a     few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old     as I am. "
BILBO,"It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?       "
GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you.       "
GANDALF,Owwwh!  
BILBO,I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it     matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. 
MERRY,He's remembered  
GANDALF,"     No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here.  If in doubt, Meriadoc,     always follow your nose. "
GANDALF,"Let me risk a little more light , Behold the     great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf. "
SAM,There's an eye-opener and no mistake 
GIMLI,Oh! 
GANDALF,Gimli! 
GIMLI,"No, no , no "
GANDALF,"Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.    ,  He is dead then.    ,  Its as I feared. "
LEGOLAS," We must move on,     we cannot linger. "
GANDALF,"      They have taken the Bridge and the second hall.  We have barred the     gates, but cannot hold them for long.  The ground shakes.  Drums    ,     Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. , A shadow moves in the dark.    , We cannot get out. They are     coming. "
GANDALF," Fool of a     Took!  ,  Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your     stupidity!  "
SAM,Frodo! 
LEGOLAS,Orcs! 
ARAGORN,Get back! and     stay close to Gandalf. 
FRODO,     Excuse me. That man in the corner.  Who is he ? 
BARLIMAN,"He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are.      Wandering the wilds.  What his right name is, I've never heard, but     round here, he's known as Strider. "
FRODO,Strider 
RING,Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins!  Baggins! 
PIPPIN,"Baggins ?  Sure I know a Baggins!  He's over     there.  Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his     mother's side , and my     third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me.  "
FRODO,Pippin! 
PIPPIN,Steady on! 
MEN,Oh! 
SAURON VOICE,"You cannot hide!  , I see you!    ,There     is no life in the void , Only death! "
STRIDER,You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill! 
FRODO,What do you want ? 
STRIDER,A little more caution from you!  That is no trinket     you carry! 
FRODO,I carry nothing 
STRIDER,"Indeed , I can avoid being seen if I wish.      But to disappear entirely     That is a rare gift! "
BILBO,"You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've     only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here,     oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart    ,     but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge     cake! , I can make     you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?        "
GANDALF,"Just tea, thank you.       "
BILBO,"Oh right. ,     You don't mind if I do, do you?  "
GANDALF,Oh not at all!       
VOICE,Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! 
BILBO," I'm not at     home! , It's the Sackville-Bagginses. "
VOICE,I know you're in there!       
BILBO,"They're after the house! , They've never forgiven me for living this     long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the     bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. , I want to see     mountains again, mountains Gandalf. , And     then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!     "
GANDALF,So you mean to go through with your plan then?       
BILBO,"Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are     made. , Oh, thank you.       "
GANDALF,Frodo suspects something.       
BILBO,"Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded     Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.        "
GANDALF,You will tell him wont you? 
BOROMIR,They have a cave troll! 
GIMLI,Agh!  Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who     still draws breath. 
ARAGORN,Pull! 
FRODO,Who are you ? 
STRIDER,Are you frightened? 
FRODO, Yes 
STRIDER,Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.  
SAM,Let him     go!  Or I'll have you Longshanks! 
STRIDER, You have a     stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you.  You can no     longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming 
FRODO,What are they ? 
STRIDER,"They were once men. Great Kings of Men.  The Sauron     the Deciever  gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths.  Neither living nor dead. At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One    , They     will never stop hunting you. "
FRODO,Where are you taking us ? 
STRIDER,Into the wild 
MERRY, How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?  
FRODO,"I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel     fouler. "
MERRY,He's foul enough  
FRODO,We have no choice but to trust him 
BILBO,"Yes, yes. "
GANDALF,He's very fond of you. 
BILBO,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In     fact, I mean not to.       "
BILBO,"Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing. "
BILBO,"Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to     remember.       "
SAM, But where     is he leading us ? 
STRIDER,To Rivendell Master Gamgee.  To the House of Elrond.     
SAM,D'you hear that!  Rivendell! We're going to see the     elves! 
STRIDER,Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall 
PIPPIN,What about breakfast ? 
STRIDER, You've     already had it 
PIPPIN,We've had one yes.  What about second breakfast ? 
MERRY,Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin     
PIPPIN,"What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ?     Supper!  He knows about them, doesnt he ? "
MERRY,I wouldn't count on it 
MERRY,Pippin!
